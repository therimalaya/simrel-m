  \small
  Data science is generating enormous amounts of data, and new and advanced analytical methods are constantly being developed to cope with the challenge of extracting information from such "big-data". Researchers often use simulated data to assess and document the properties of these new methods, and in this paper we present `simrel-m`, which is a versatile and transparent tool for simulating linear model data with extensive range of adjustable properties.
  The method is based on the concept of relevant components @helland1994comparison, which is equivalent to the envelope model @cook2013envelopes. It is a multi-response extension of `simrel` @saebo2015simrel, and as `simrel` the new approach is essentially based on random rotations of latent relevant components to obtain a predictor matrix $\mathbf{X}$, but in addition we introduce random rotations of latent components spanning a response space in order to obtain a multivariate response matrix $\mathbf{Y}$.
  The properties of the linear relation between $\mathbf{X}$ and $\mathbf{Y}$ are defined by a small set of input parameters which allow versatile and adjustable simulations. Sub-space rotations also allow for generating data suitable for testing variable selection methods in multi-response settings.
  The method is implemented as an R-package which serves as an extension of the existing `simrel` packages @saebo2015simrel.
