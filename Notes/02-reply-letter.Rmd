It is our opportunity to refine our research paper with constructive comments we received from the reviewer on our manuscript entitled "A tool for simulating multi-response linear model data" (Ref: CHEMOLAB_2017_377). As per the comments we have added an additional example which has helped to increase the richness of the paper. The comments on the revision is attached in a separate document.
