* Meeting: 13 March 2017, Monday
** Introduction
- Motivation
- What has been done before?
- What is our contribution here?
- What is coming up in these chapters
** Statistical Model
- Random Regression Model (m = 1)
- Say something about beta
- Introduce Q and R
- Eigenvectors, Principal Components and Transformations
** Relevant Components
- Refer to some papers for m = 1 cases
- Discuss on m = 1 case and extend it to m > 1
- X envelope and Y envelope
** Model Parameterization
- Simplifying Assumption
- Discuss about reduction in number of parameter on simplification and parameterization
- Introduce $\gamma$, $\Sigma_{ww}$, $\rho_W^2$ and $\Sigma_{zw}$
- How we simulate covariance matrix which satisfy coefficient of determination
** Sampling of W and Z
** Rotation to Y and X from W and Z
- Discuss rotation and how we obtain other properties such as $R^2$ and covariance matrix
** Examples
** Discussion
