* Meeting: 13 March 2017, Monday
** Introduction
- Motivation
- What has been done before?
- What is our contribution here?
- What is coming up in these chapters
** Statistical Model
- Random Regression Model (m = 1)
- Say something about beta
- Introduce Q and R
- Eigenvectors, Principal Components and Transformations
** Relevant Components
- Refer to some papers for m = 1 cases
- Discuss on m = 1 case and extend it to m > 1
- X envelope and Y envelope
** Model Parameterization
- Simplifying Assumption
- Discuss about reduction in number of parameter on simplification and parameterization
- Introduce $\gamma$, $\Sigma_{ww}$, $\rho_W^2$ and $\Sigma_{zw}$
- How we simulate covariance matrix which satisfy coefficient of determination
** Sampling of W and Z
   Give an example and follow it through out the rotation section
** Rotation to Y and X from W and Z
- Discuss rotation and how we obtain other properties such as $R^2$ and covariance matrix
** Examples
**** Also add PLS1 model
**** Just vary R2 and Gamma, following values for the parameters will be good
      | parameters | value                        |
      |------------+------------------------------|
      | n          | 100                          |
      | p          | 25                           |
      | R2         | 0.8, 0.8, 0.4; 0.4, 0.4, 0.4 |
      | gamma      | 0.3, 0.9                     |
      | relpos     | 1,6; 2, 5; 3, 4              |
      | ypos       | 1, 4; 2, 5; 3                |
**** This is a paper about ~Simrel-m~ and not an exhaustive study of  properties of estimation methods, so just state small facts about them
** Discussion
