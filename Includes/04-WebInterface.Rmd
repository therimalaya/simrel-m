# Web Interface #

In order to give an interface for `simrel-m`, we have created a shiny app which  allows users to input the simulation parameters through different input fields. Figure~\@ref(fig:AppSimulatr) shows a screenshot for the application. The application constitute of three main sections from where user can interact with  this simulation approach. A random seed can be selected using section in Figure~\@ref(fig:AppSimulatr) (a) so that a particular set of data can be  simulated. Figure~\@ref(fig:AppSimulatr) (b) has all the input panel where  parameter for simulation can be entered. Here user also has option to simulate univariate (uses `simrel` package in CRAN), bivariate (not yet availiable in CRAN)  and multivariate simulation (`simrel-m`). In addition, a simulated R-object of  `simrel` can be download as `Rdata` format (section (e) in Figure~\@ref(fig:AppSimulatr)).  The object consitute of the simulated data along with other properties such as coefficient of determination for each response, true regression coefficients and rotation matrices.

All `simrel-m` parameters can be entered using simple user interface where a vectors are separated with comma(,) and lists are separated with  semicolon(;). For instance, the relevant position considered  [implementation](#implementation) section can be entered as `1, 6; 2, 5; 3, 4` which is equivalent to R syntax `list(c(1, 6), c(2, 5), c(3, 4))`.

The application not only allows users to simulate data but also gives some insight on simulated data using some plots. Section (c) in Figure~\@ref(fig:AppSimulatr) shows these plots for the simulated data. The first plot shows the true regression coefficients for different predictor variables. The second plot has the covariance of relevant component with each response along with eigenvalue of predictors. In this plot, we can see that if the components with small eigenvalues is relevant but with large eigenvalues are not relvant than the model will be difficult to predict. An estimated covariance of these relevant components is in third figure of this section. Along with these main sections, section (d) in the figure contains additional analysis performed with the simulated data such as its estimation with different methods. This section is still under development.
